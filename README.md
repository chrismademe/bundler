# Fascio

A basic asset bundler/task runner for your frontend assets.

## Todo

-   [ ] Add better handling of errors and warnings from `fs-extra`
-   [ ] Make the `write` methods of SCSS and JS compilers behave consistenty with how they treat file paths.
-   [ ] Add support for more compilers (possibly PostCSS, Babel etc.)
